              A sugar skull is a type of Calavera or representation of a human
              skull. These are called sugar skulls since they’re traditionally
              made of sugar. Today sugar skulls are often made of a variety of
              things like chocolate, nuts, and other treats.

            <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-2">
              These skulls play a large role in the Day of the Dead. This
              holiday follows All Saints’ Day, and it’s a way for people to
              honor their dead. Families flock to gravesites, offering gifts and
              food for their ancestors. People join together to eat, drink, tell
              stories, and celebrate the circle of life.

              <h3>Day of the dead</h3>
              <p>
                The Day of the Dead (Spanish: Día de Muertos or Día de los
                Muertos) is a holiday traditionally celebrated on November 1 and
                2, though other days, such as October 31 or November 6, may be
                included depending on the locality. It largely originated in
                Mexico, where it is mostly observed, but also in other places,
                especially by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere. Although
                associated with the Western Christian Allhallowtide observances
                of All Hallow's Eve, All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, it has
                a much less solemn tone and is portrayed as a holiday of joyful
                celebration rather than mourning.The multi-day holiday involves
                family and friends gathering to pay respects and to remember
                friends and family members who have died. These celebrations can
                take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and
                anecdotes about the departed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditions connected with the holiday include honoring the
                deceased using calaveras and aztec marigold flowers known as
                cempazúchitl, building home altars called ofrendas with the
                favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting
                graves with these items as gifts for the deceased. The
                celebration is not solely focused on the dead, as it is also
                common to give gifts to friends such as candy sugar skulls, to
                share traditional pan de muerto with family and friends, and to
                write light-hearted and often irreverent verses in the form of
                mock epitaphs dedicated to living friends and acquaintances, a
                literary form known as calaveras literarias.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List
                of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish
                calavera), which celebrants represent in masks, called calacas
                (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as chocolate or
                sugar skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient
                on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the
                living and the dead. Other holiday foods include pan de muerto,
                a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to
                skulls, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted
                bones.

              <h3>Origins and history</h3>
              <p>
                Views differ on whether the festivity has indigenous
                pre-Hispanic roots, whether it is a more modern adaptation of an
                existing European tradition, or a combination of both as a
                manifestation of syncretism. Similar traditions can be traced
                back to Medieval Europe, where celebrations like All Saints' Day
                and All Souls' Day are observed on the same days in places like
                Spain and Southern Europe. Critics of the native American origin
                claim that even though pre-Columbian Mexico had traditions that
                honored the dead, current depictions of the festivity have more
                in common with European traditions of Danse macabre and their
                allegories of life and death personified in the human skeleton
                to remind us the ephemeral nature of life. Over the past
                decades, however, Mexican academia has increasingly questioned
                the validity of this assumption, even going as far as calling it
                a politically motivated fabrication. Historian Elsa Malvido,
                researcher for the Mexican INAH and founder of the institute's
                Taller de Estudios sobre la Muerte, was the first to do so in
                the context of her wider research into Mexican attitudes to
                death and disease across the centuries. Malvido completely
                discards a native or even syncretic origin arguing that the
                tradition can be fully traced to Medieval Europe. She highlights
                the existence of similar traditions on the same day, not just in
                Spain, but in the rest of Catholic Southern Europe and Latin
                America such as altars for the dead, sweets in the shape of
                skulls and bread in the shape of bones.
              </p>
              <p>
                The historian Ricardo Pérez Montfort has further demonstrated
                how the ideology known as indigenismo became more and more
                closely linked to post-revolutionary official projects whereas
                Hispanismo was identified with conservative political stances.
                This exclusive nationalism began to displace all other cultural
                perspectives to the point that in the 1930s, the Aztec god
                Quetzalcoatl was officially promoted by the government as a
                substitute for the Spanish Three Kings tradition, with a person
                dressed up as the deity offering gifts to poor children.

            <p>
              In Mexico, the colorful, much anticipated, Day of the Dead
              celebrations are generally celebrated in the states from Mexico
              City south. This includes Michoacan, Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca,
              Veracruz, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Chiapas and the Yucatan. Northern
              Mexico, with its less indigenous and more European roots, spend
              the day scrubbing graves and going to Mass… not having music,
              drinks and parties in the cemeteries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Folks in parts of Italy, Spain, Central & South America and the
              Philippines all celebrate All Souls and All Saints Day on November
              1st and 2nd. Special Masses and perhaps cleaning of the cemetery
              tombs are part of the traditional activities…
            </p>
            <p>
              Chocolate sugar skulls are hand molded & decorated and sold by the
              thousands at the Sugar Skull Fair. Candy makers work for 4-6
              months to have enough merchandise for the sale. Sugar skulls are
              sometimes eaten, but their main function is to adorn the altars
              and tombs with a sugary delight for the visiting spirits!
              Miniature candy skulls are made for the baby angelitos and are
              displayed on the home ofrendas on November 1… then replaced with
              full size skulls on November 2 for the returning adult spirits!
